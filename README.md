# Singularity
This is a small project that I will play with when I'm bored.

There is a science fiction book series call Singularity by William Hertling. In it, AI's use humans to learn battle strategies by creating a real-time strategy game which was dependent upon the users writing code and algorithms which will manage their units.

This project is a small scale proof of concept of that idea. If I make even a rudimentary, text-based, version of it, I'll be happy.
